Lecture 4.1 - PageRank

I learned about it for the first time in Coursera from "Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra." by Imperial College London. The ideas of Random Walks, Flow equations and the definitions of eigenvectors and eigenvalues converge here.

Lecture 4.2 - PageRank: How to Solve?

Jure talked about getting the PageRank vectors through iteratively conducting matrix product. There are also justifications as random teleport to solve the problems of dead ends and spider traps. 

Lecture 4.3 - Random walk with Restarts

Jure talked about PageRank, Personalized PageRank, and Random Walk with Restarts. They are essentially the same algorithm with variations. All of them have different forms of representation but are the same thing. They are all optimized through power iterations.

Lecture 4.4 - Matrix Factorization and Node Embeddings

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r12qJZZVtqc&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn&index=13

Jure covers the formula to factorize the computations of PageRank, Random Walk. Then talked about the limitations of methods covered in this lecture.
