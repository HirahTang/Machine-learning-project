# Honor Assignments of the Coursera Specialisation Advanced Machine Learning:

## Course 1: Introduction to Deep Learning

### Week 2: NumpyNN

Implement Neural Networks using pure Numpy. Improve the vanilla neural network using Xavier Initialisation so the model can converge even when the layer number is large (>5)

### Week 3: Fine-tuning InceptionV3 for flowers classification

### Week 4 Unsupervised representation learning

#### Assignment 1: Autoencoder

Encoder - Decoder architecture for peoples' faces. Include many interesting tasks (de-noise, finding similar faces, etc.)
