# Honor Assignments of the Coursera Specialisation Advanced Machine Learning:

## Course 1: Introduction to Deep Learning

### Week 2: NumpyNN

Implement Neural Networks using pure Numpy. Improve the vanilla neural network using Xavier Initialisation so the model can converge even when the layer number is large (>5)
